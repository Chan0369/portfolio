info2: "The challenge was to create/design with only a few colours. The ojects in the scene camn not be blended in with other ojects. The character had to be Josh Agle style or it would not look like a Josh Agle inspired piece. Another challenge was to have the perspectives right. Having the perspective not matching the scene with make the scene look like things are falling apart."
